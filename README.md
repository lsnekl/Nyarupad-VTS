Vtube Studio gamepad plugin modified to work with Wii Nunchuck Controller 

As of right now, I am planning to also create arduino code in order to interface with the Wii Nunchuck controller. It should not be too complicated and will be added 
here when finished, as well as how to set up the arduino and breadboard, etc
